<h1>Freddie's Fiets</h1>
<p>AirBnB clone that uses Freddie Mercury branding to make bike ('fiets' in Dutch) rentals more fun.</p>
<p>The app is designed to have users create an account and to list their own bike, or rent a new one from a variety of different categories (Mountain, road, BMX, etc.)</p>

<h2>TARGET</h2>
<p>Any cyclist in the Netherlands who may need to rent a new bike, or who may want to lease theirs out for a period of time.</p>

<h2>PAIN</h2>
<p>Ease of access to different bike types for an affordable price, without worrying for long term storage of holding many bicycles.</p>

<h2>SOLUTION</h2>
<p>Rent a bike for your spontaneous weekend cycle trip through Freddie's Fiets.</p>
